Improvements suggested based on the codebase analysis:

1. Documentation
Expand the main Readme.md with setup, usage, and API details (currently only a DeepWiki link).
Add migration instructions to README (how to create, upgrade, downgrade migrations).
Document environment variables required (e.g., API_KEY).
2. Code Quality & Structure
Move utility functions (e.g., calculate_file_sha256, calculate_url_sha256) to a utils.py for reuse.
Refactor large endpoint logic in app.py into service/helper modules for maintainability.
Add type hints to functions for clarity.
3. Error Handling & UX
Improve error handling in Flask endpoints (return user-friendly error pages, log details).
Add flash messages or alerts for user feedback in templates.
4. Security
Do not hardcode secrets (SECRET_KEY); load from environment variables.
Validate and sanitize file uploads (limit file size, allowed types).
5. Testing & CI
Add unit and integration tests for API and database logic.
Provide a test configuration and sample test data.
Add a CI workflow for linting and tests.
6. Database & Migrations
Document migration workflow in README.
Add sample migration commands and troubleshooting tips.
7. API & Features
Add pagination or filtering to scan results if the dataset grows.
Consider supporting more resource types (domains, IPs) if VirusTotal API allows.
Add download links for scan reports.
8. UI/UX
Add navigation links between dashboard, results, and error pages.
Improve template styling and responsiveness.
