## VirusTotal Client

This project is documented on DeepWiki.

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/anpa6841/virustotal-client)

Improvements suggested based on the codebase analysis:

1. Documentation
Expand the main Readme.md with setup, usage, and API details (currently only a DeepWiki link).
Add migration instructions to README (how to create, upgrade, downgrade migrations).
Document environment variables required (e.g., API_KEY).
2. Code Quality & Structure
Move utility functions (e.g., calculate_file_sha256, calculate_url_sha256) to a utils.py for reuse.
Refactor large endpoint logic in app.py into service/helper modules for maintainability.
Add type hints to functions for clarity.
3. Error Handling & UX
Improve error handling in Flask endpoints (return user-friendly error pages, log details).
Add flash messages or alerts for user feedback in templates.
4. Security
Do not hardcode secrets (SECRET_KEY); load from environment variables.
Validate and sanitize file uploads (limit file size, allowed types).
5. Testing & CI
Add unit and integration tests for API and database logic.
Provide a test configuration and sample test data.
Add a CI workflow for linting and tests.
6. Database & Migrations
Document migration workflow in README.
Add sample migration commands and troubleshooting tips.
7. API & Features
Add pagination or filtering to scan results if the dataset grows.
Consider supporting more resource types (domains, IPs) if VirusTotal API allows.
Add download links for scan reports.
8. UI/UX
Add navigation links between dashboard, results, and error pages.
Improve template styling and responsiveness.


## Code-level improvements

Move Utility Functions to a Separate Module

Functions like calculate_file_sha256, calculate_url_sha256, and get_analysis_status in app.py should be moved to a utils.py for reuse and clarity.
Refactor Large Endpoint Functions

Break up large Flask route functions into smaller, testable helper functions. For example, the scan logic can be split into:
file upload handling
VirusTotal API interaction
database update
result rendering
Class-Based Views

For complex endpoints, consider using Flaskâ€™s class-based views for better organization.
Type Annotations

Add type hints to all functions for better readability and tooling support.
Consistent Error Handling

Centralize error handling (e.g., custom error handler or decorator) to avoid repeated try/except blocks.
Database Logic Separation

Move database operations (CRUD for Analysis) into a dedicated data access/service layer.
Configuration Management

Use a config file or environment variables for all settings (e.g., secret keys, database URI).
Testing

Add unit tests for utility functions and service logic.
Use mocks for external API calls (VirusTotal).
Input Validation

Validate and sanitize all user inputs (file uploads, URLs) before processing.
